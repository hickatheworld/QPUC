# TLMVPSC/server
## Socket.io Server 

This is TLMVPSC's socket.io server, the very core of the app.

## Get started
`cd` into this directory to work on TLMVPSC/server.

Run the `start` npm script to start the server in development mode and the `build` npm script to build the API server for production.

You can also run these scripts from the parent directory by prefixing `server:` to their names.

## Progress
See `TLMVPSC/server`'s [Projects page](https://github.com/hickatheworlds/TLMVPSC/projects/3).
