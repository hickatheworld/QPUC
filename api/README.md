# TLMVPSC/api
## Backend API 
This is TLMVPSC's Questions API, made with [Express](https://expressjs.com/). It makes a connection with MongoDB to read/write questions.

## Get started
`cd` into this directory to work on `TLMVPSC/api`.

Run the `start` npm script to start the server in development mode and the `build` npm script to build the API server for production.

You can also run these scripts from the parent directory by prefixing `api:` to their names.

## Progress
See `TLMVPSC/api`'s [Projects page](https://github.com/hickatheworlds/TLMVPSC/projects/1).
