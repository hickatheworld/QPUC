# QPUC
## The little tool to play some little games

This app is a support to enhance question-answer games such as [Tout le monde veut prendre sa place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tout_le_monde_veut_prendre_sa_place) (Hold on to your seat!) that I like to play with my friends online, usually only vocally.

It allows you, the **gamemaster**, to:
 - Store questions and answers
 - Keep track of scores
 - Broadcast sounds

And it allows your players to:
 - Clearly see your question and the potential answers.
 - Press the buzzer to lock their spot to answer the question
 - Keep track of their scores!

## Get started
To work on QPUC, choose what you want between `api` (express/mongoose), `frontend` (React) and `server` (socket.io). 
Go into one of these three directories and see their respective README.MD.

## Status
This is still a work in progress, see [Projects](https://github.com/hickatheworld/QPUC/projects) to have an idea of the progress.

## Tech
QPUC is built with:
 - [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org/)
 - [React](https://reactjs.org/) ([create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/))
 - [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
 - [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/)
 - [Socket.io](https://socket.io/)
