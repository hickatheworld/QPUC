# QPUC/frontend
## The frontend side of QPUC.

This is the frontend of QPUC, made with [React](https://reactjs.org/).

## Get started
`cd` into this directory to work on QPUC/frontend.

Run the `start` npm script to start the development server and the `build` npm script to build the frontend for production.

You can also run these scripts from the parent directory by prefixing `frontend:` to their names.

## Progress
See `QPUC/frontend`'s [Projects page](https://github.com/hickatheworlds/QPUC/projects/2).
